# Stateless Chat

Stateless Chat is a web application that allows users to easily create `rooms` to chat in, privately and securely using text. It does not require any signup by default. In future versions, users will be able to `reserve` a username, but this feature will not be included in the first version.

The application will use Deno with the Fresh web framework and Tailwind CSS for styling. The color scheme will be a dark theme with a purple accent color and a light theme with the same accent color: purple.

# Key Features

1. **User Onboarding**:
   - On the first visit, users are prompted to enter a preferred `Username`. The username will not need to be unique unless the user chooses to reserve it in the future.

2. **Room Creation and Joining**:
   - Users can create a new `Room` with an automatically generated room ID and password. This information will be displayed to the creator for sharing.
   - Users can join a room by entering a `Room ID` and `Room Password`.
   - Users can also join a room via a URL in the format: `baseurl.com/room/[encoded-room-id]#[encoded-room-password]`. If a user attempts to join a room without a password by visiting `baseurl.com/room/[encoded-room-id]`, they will be prompted to enter the password.

3. **Security and Privacy**:
   - Only the username and a `TOKEN` generated by creating an HMAC of `(username + room-id + timestamp + salt)` using the room password will be stored.
   - All messages will be end-to-end encrypted to ensure that even the platform cannot read them.
   - Minimal data storage: consider using local or session storage for user data.

4. **Design and Accessibility**:
   - The application will have a responsive design to ensure usability on different devices.
   - Accessibility best practices will be followed to make the application inclusive.

5. **Scalability and Future-Proofing**:
   - Modular architecture will be implemented to facilitate the addition of new features such as public rooms.
   - Performance monitoring and logging will be in place to maintain and improve application performance.
